"""
The sqlite file is the entire state of the bot. We never rely on the local
disk surviving (Termux gets killed, Railway disks are ephemeral) — instead
we push the db file to a private Telegram channel on a timer, and on every
boot we try to pull the newest copy down before starting the bot, if no
local copy exists yet.

This is what lets you `git clone` the project on a brand-new machine,
just fill in .env, run `python main.py`, and get your real data back.
